# mnist_digit_recognition

ðŸ§  What it Does:
Your program learns to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) using deep learning.

ðŸ”§ What You Did (Step-by-Step):
Loaded the MNIST dataset
â†’ A collection of 70,000 handwritten digit images.

Preprocessed the data
â†’ Scaled pixel values to 0â€“1 and reshaped images for the model.

Built a CNN model
â†’ A type of deep learning model that works great with images.

Used data augmentation
â†’ Slightly altered training images to help the model generalize better.

Trained the model
â†’ It learned patterns from training images over 10 rounds (epochs).

Tested the model
â†’ Achieved 99.38% accuracy on new, unseen images â€” excellent!

Visualized performance
â†’ Accuracy graph showed how well it learned over time.

Saved the model
â†’ So you can use it later without retraining.

âœ… Final Result:
Your model can now predict handwritten digits with 99.38% accuracy!
